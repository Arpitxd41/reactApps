# SPACE X

---

> An assignment I took over to create a react landing page of space X. The page holds the collection of data made available by the American Aerospace Company for such applications.
> This React application showcases information about SpaceX, including events, missions, technology, and collaborations with other space agencies. The application uses SpaceX API to dynamically fetch and display relevant content.

## About ReactJS
React is a framework that employs Webpack to automatically compile React, JSX, and ES6 code while handling CSS file prefixes. *React is a JavaScript-based UI development library*. Although React is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development. The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries for web development. React offers various extensions for entire application architectural support, such as Flux and React Native, beyond mere UI.

The SpaceX landing page is built using React, *a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.* React offers a *component-based architecture*, enabling the creation of modular and *reusable UI elements*. Here's how React is utilized in the frontend of the SpaceX landing page:

- **Component-Based Structure:**   
The landing page is organized into distinct components, each responsible for a specific part of the UI. Components include the Navbar, Dropdown, Event Cards, Mission Cards, and more. This modular structure allows for easier management, maintenance, and reusability of code.
- **State Management with '*useState*':**   
React's `useState` hook is employed to manage the state of various components within the application. For example, the state is used to handle the current selection in the dropdown and dynamically update the displayed content based on the selected option.
- **Fetching Data with '*fetch*' and '*useEffect*':**   
Data from the *SpaceX API* is retrieved using the fetch API within the `useEffect` hook. This ensures that data is fetched after the component is rendered, preventing potential blocking of the main thread.
- **Conditional Rendering:**   
React's conditional rendering is *utilized to display different components or content based on conditions such as user interaction or data availability.* For instance, the Event Cards are conditionally displayed once the data is successfully fetched.
- **Props for Data Passing:** Components receive data as props, allowing for the seamless passing of information from parent to child components. For example, the Event Cards component receives data about SpaceX events and renders them dynamically.
- **CSS Styling and Animation:** CSS is used for styling components and achieving the desired layout. Additionally, CSS is employed to implement animations like the starry background, enhancing the visual appeal of the landing page.
### Responsive Design:
Utilizing React and CSS, the landing page is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

> React's flexibility, component-based architecture, and efficient state management contribute to creating a dynamic and engaging SpaceX landing page, offering users an enjoyable and informative browsing experience.

- **Event Cards:**   
Displays numerous remarkable and ground breaking events with all the relevant details which will let the users get to all the info on the respective events. *The event data is fetched from the SpaceX API using the fetch API within a `useEffect` hook. The fetched data is then stored and managed in state using the `useState` hook.* This data is then displayed in the Event Card components. The Event Card in the SpaceX landing page React application is a user interface component designed to display information about specific events related to SpaceX. Each Event Card contains the details of the missions and the events of the spacex. Cards are designed to be visually appealing and structured for easy consumption of mission-related information.
- **Mission Cards:**   
Showcase SpaceX missions and their information. Both kind of card components are designed to provide a snapshot of events and missions, allowing users to quickly understand key details at a glance. The cards are displayed in an organized manner, enhancing the overall user experience of the SpaceX landing page. The Mission Card is another user interface component used to showcase information about SpaceX missions. The data for each mission is fetched using the fetch API and managed with React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. Each Mission Card includes the following details of the missions.

## Starry Background Animation
The SpaceX landing page features a captivating starry background animation that enhances the overall aesthetics and provides a representation of the aerospace theme. The animation creates a dynamic and immersive experience for visitors to the landing page.

- **Animation Effect:**   
The starry background is designed to give the illusion of a starry night sky, creating a visually appealing and engaging backdrop for the landing page.
- **Aerospace Representation:**   
The starry background aligns with the aerospace theme, symbolizing the vastness of space and the exploratory nature of SpaceX as an aerospace company.
- **Technologies Used:**   
The animation is implemented using CSS and JavaScript to create a seamless and enchanting effect that adds depth and character to the landing page. This starry background animation adds a visually captivating element to the landing page, reinforcing the connection with SpaceX's focus on space exploration and technology. It enhances the user experience by providing an aesthetically pleasing and immersive environment.

## Hero Section with Carousel
The Hero Section, positioned at the top of the landing page, is a key area designed to instantly captivate and engage the user. It features a carousel component showcasing different images related to space exploration and SpaceX missions. Here's the breakdown of the elements within this dynamic Hero Section:
- **Carousel:**   
The Hero Section incorporates a carousel component, providing a visually appealing way to cycle through multiple images related to space exploration, SpaceX projects, and missions. This dynamic element immediately captures the user's attention and adds an interactive touch to the page.
- **Main Heading (Title):**   
Displayed within the carousel, a concise and impactful main heading introduces the purpose of the landing page. For example, "Journey Through the Cosmos with SpaceX."
- **Subheading:**   
Accompanying the main heading, a subheading further elaborates on the main message, enticing the user to explore the missions and achievements of SpaceX.
- **Call-to-Action (CTA):**   
Positioned prominently within the carousel or below it, a compelling CTA button encourages the user to take action. For instance, "Explore Missions" or "Discover More."
- **Background Animation:**   
The carousel operates against a backdrop featuring a starry background animation, symbolizing the vastness and wonder of outer space. This animation adds a mesmerizing visual dimension to the Hero Section, aligning perfectly with the aerospace theme.
- **Responsive Design:**   
The Hero Section, including the carousel and accompanying elements, is designed to ensure seamless functionality and an attractive layout across a range of devices, ensuring an optimal user experience regardless of screen size.

The carousel, serving as the focal point of the Hero Section, effectively showcases various captivating visuals, captivating the user and setting the tone for the rest of the landing page. This dynamic and visually appealing introduction invites the user to delve deeper into the world of space exploration and SpaceX's remarkable missions.
